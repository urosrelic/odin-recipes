    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 pound sweet Italian sausage
        </li>
        <li>
            ¾ pound lean ground beef
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ cup minced onion
        </li>
        <li>
            2 cloves garlic, crushed
        </li>
        <li>
            1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        Step 1<br><br>

        In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. <br>Stir in
        crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. <br>Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian
        seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. <br>Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours,
        stirring
        occasionally.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 2<br><br>

        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10
        minutes.
        <br>Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. <br>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining
        parsley,
        and 1/2 teaspoon salt. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 3<br><br>

        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 4<br><br>

        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. <br>Arrange 6 noodles
        lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. <br>Top with a third of
        mozzarella
        cheese slices. <br>Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        <br>Repeat
        layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.<br> Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either
        spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Step 6<br><br>

        Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes
        before serving.
